TD_LIB

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a common library procedures which are shared not only among the
CM_TOOLS utilities, but also with other programs which are not part of
CM_TOOLS.

Portions of this library are portable to VAX/VMS, where it is used for support
of various programs.

To construct the library, you should first run 'configure'.  Unless you're
modifying the code, you don't need to use the "-with-warnings" flag (it sets a
lot more definitions, that causes some sed programs to truncate the
configuration).
