-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This subtree is used for common library procedures which are shared not only
among the programs of CM_TOOLS, but also with other programs which are not
part of CM_TOOLS.

The programs in CM_TOOLS are built using the archive herein.
The 'install' rule copies the archive to the public library directory of
CM_TOOLS.

A copy of this subtree resides on VAX/VMS, where the (VMS-portable) procedures
are available for use by non-CM_TOOLS programs.
