The procedures in the PORTUNIX library are tested by compiling them with
the TEST preprocessor variable defined.

A unix regression test-suite has not been constructed because the programs are
not intended to operate on unix -- they are portability aids, which "run" on
unix in a limited way.

The modules which contain VMS-specific code (such as 'unixdir.c') cannot be
run on unix at all.
